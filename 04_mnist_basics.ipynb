    "in 2018 after triumphing despite the deep skepticism and disinterest of the wider machine learning and statistics community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoff Hinton has told of how even academic papers showing dramatically better results than anything previously published would be rejected by top journals and conferences, just because they used a neural network.  \n",
    "Yann Lecun's work on convolutional neural networks, which we will study in the next section, showed that these models could read handwritten text—something that had never been achieved before.  \n",
    "However, his breakthrough was ignored by most researchers, even as it was used commercially to read 10% of the checks in the US!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these three Turing Award winners, there are many other researchers who have battled to get us to where we are today.  \n",

    "including working with his student Sepp Hochreiter on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (widely used for speech recognition and other text modeling tasks, and used in the IMDb example in <<chapter_intro>>).  \n",
    "Perhaps most important of all, Paul Werbos in 1974 invented back-propagation for neural networks, the technique shown in this chapter and used universally for training neural networks ([Werbos 1994](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Roots_of_Backpropagation.html?id=WdR3OOM2gBwC)).  \n",

    "Congratulations: you now know how to create and train a deep neural network from scratch!  \n",
    "We've gone through quite a few steps to get to this point, **but you might be surprised at how simple it really is.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are at this point, it is a good opportunity to define, and review, some jargon and key concepts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network contains a lot of numbers, but they are only of two types:  \n",
    "numbers that are calculated, and the parameters that these numbers are calculated from.  \n",
    "This gives us the two most important pieces of jargon to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Activations:: Numbers that are calculated (both by linear and nonlinear layers)**\n",
    "- **Parameters:: Numbers that are randomly initialized, and optimized (that is, the numbers that define the model)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will often talk in this book about activations and parameters.  \n",
    "Remember that they have very specific meanings.  \n",
    "They are numbers.  \n",
    "They are not abstract concepts, but they are actual specific numbers that are in your model.  \n",
    "**Part of becoming a good deep learning practitioner is getting used to the idea of actually looking at your activations and parameters,**  \n",
    "and plotting them and testing whether they are behaving correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our activations and parameters are all contained in *tensors*.**  \n",
    "These are simply regularly shaped arrays—for example, a matrix.  \n",
    "Matrices have rows and columns; we call these the *axes* or *dimensions*.  \n",
    "**The number of dimensions of a tensor is its *rank*.**  \n",
    "There are some special tensors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rank zero: scalar\n",
    "- Rank one: vector\n",
    "- Rank two: matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**A neural network contains a number of layers.  \n",
    "Each layer is either *linear* or *nonlinear*.  \n",
    "We generally alternate between these two kinds of layers in a neural network.**  \n",
    "Sometimes people refer to both a linear layer and its subsequent nonlinearity together as a single layer.  \n",
    "Yes, this is confusing.  \n",
